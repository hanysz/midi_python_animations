Make main video file with command line:

To do: adjust frequency, currently the image is too much on the left
Want to set top to freq of highest note times 1.2 maybe?
Take bottom down to half of lowest note?

highest is F#8 MIDI note number 102 = 2960 Hz
lowest is C#2 MIDI note number 25 = 34.6 Hz

ffmpeg -i /home/alex/midi/2020-polglase+haydn/2020-06-03-polglase.wav -filter_complex "[0:a]showcqt=text=0:bar_g=5:basefreq=30:endfreq=6000:size=1280x720,format=yuv420p[v]" -map "[v]" -map 0:a temp.mp4

then add titles to the beginning with add_titles.py
