Messy python code that makes the animations for [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVtiLYoo1dCpG3xOdt4y6SQ).

Created for personal use only but I don't mind if people borrow ideas from this code.  Shared here without warranty.

Update February 2022: currently in quite a messy state, as I'm in the middle of migrating from Python 2 to Python 3, and from pygame to cairo for the graphics backend!  I might tidy up one day.  Or then again, I might prefer to spend that time playing the piano.
