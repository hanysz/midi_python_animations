Top part of the screen: balls falling vertically under gravity
  A separate ball for each key
  Data: 88 arrays of note onset times
  To draw at time t:
    go through all 88 arrays
    binary search to find the previous and next notes for time t
    calculate whether the ball should be on screen, and the height

   Parameters:
     g -- acceleration due to gravity
     frame height (top of the frame should be just off the screen)
     and then use this to calculate on screen time (top of frame to key based on g)


Bottom part of the screen: side view of piano keyboard
  When a ball hits a key, it goes down and stays down for the note-on duration,
  and also lights up (brightness = key velocity)
    -- lighting up is needed so that black keys don't just disappear

Lazy measurements on my piano:
  white keys 25 mm wide
  black keys 10mm wide
