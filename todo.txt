Multimedia:
  fix the "integer rounding wobbles"
  play midi through a port (e.g. to PianoTeq)
  play audio, with parameters for delay/sync -- done
  mix down to video -- done
  transparency and/or additive colours
    use surface blitting? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/601776/what-do-the-blend-modes-in-pygame-mean
    instead of pygame.draw.ellips(screen, ...)
    want
      create tempSurface
      pygame.draw.ellipse(tempSurface, ...)
      screen.blit(tempSurface, dest, None, pygame.BLEND_ADD)
        dest is either (x, y) or a rect
	None is the area to draw on (None really means all!)

Code:
  precompute static visual properties for note, e.g. y-coordinate
  refactor as a module?
  fetch parameters from text configuration file, e.g. using PyYAML?
  fetch PPQN programmatically -- done

  interactive UI? with drawing modules from plugin folder?
    classes for note, chord, link, links_out, links_in?

Visuals
  piano roll with circles
  circles moving in curved paths, changing size to get "closer"
  bouncing ball
  "organic" paths (drifting)
  ripples (how do I show the length and velocity?)
